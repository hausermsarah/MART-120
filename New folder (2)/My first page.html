                    Position Paper for the General Assembly Third Committee
                    
                    The topics brought to the attention of the General Assembly Third Committee (GA3) are Ensuring Equitable and Inclusive Access to Education and The Right of Privacy in the Digital Age. Georgia believes if we can approach these topics with a sense of self-accountability, capacity comprehension, and pragmatism, we can anticipate robust diplomatic progress with the topics presented before the Third Committee. Georgia is prepared to lead this effort at our forthcoming conference.
                    
                    I. Ensuring Equitable and Inclusive Access to Education
                    
                    In recent years proper access to equitable and inclusive means of education have been put at significant risk, and the Covid-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this troubling issue. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has revealed that over 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries were out of school during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. These circumstances continue to devastate an already ongoing education crisis witnessed before the pandemic arose, as the world population only held a 53% secondary education completion rate in 2019. Furthermore, Georgia also realizes that those who lack access to adequate education frequently suffer from social and economic advantages. Quality education is also a critical component of assisting individuals and societies in developing and creating a productive future. With this in mind, Georgia supports the United Nations (UN) efforts towards enhancing access to education, which is one of the primary goals found within the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) cultivated by the UN. Ultimately, Georgia encourages Member States to join us in striving for a standard that surpasses these current goals.
                    
                    Access to education was established as a human right under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948. Article 26 of the (UDHR) states that everyone has the right to education; “Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.” Amid the twentieth century, public education was aimed to help support national citizenship and developmental progress for Member States through imperative schooling for youth. However, today the COVID-19 pandemic has posed an extreme hazard to the quality of our education. Nearly a decade ago, the international community committed to achieving Education for All by 2015. Along with Education for All, in 2015, the international committee expanded its commitment to education with the adoption of (SDG) 4 and 17. These SDGs call for developed and developing member states to end educational adversities such as poverty, inequality and create a greener future for all. It should also be known that SDG 4 explicitly states that all should have access to an equitable and sustainable education. Georgia has been making strides to ensure equitable and inclusive access to education for all. In recent years Georgia has implemented a new educational framework with the help of Estonia and Poland to support the government of Georgia in strengthening the quality of inclusiveness of our national education system. This new approach to education introduces educational innovations, new learning strategies, and digital technologies for education. Children with access to this framework will acquire the skills and competencies needed to prosper in the current technological world and allow equal access to these educational innovations. Taking all of this into account, Georgia prompts Member States to work together to address the common challenges facing education today.
                    
                    Georgia emphasizes the need for Member States to coordinate efforts to assist fellow Member States with gaining access to equitable and inclusive education. As such, Georgia proposes that members of the international community implement a variation of the current framework Georgia is working on with Estonia and Poland. This framework would help struggling Member States learn new ways to possess an inclusive education system while staying updated with the digital age. This fabric of this approach revolves around a child-centered and competency-based curriculum, which will also prove to be innovative and interactive for children and teachers alike. With this said, Georgia brings forward a proposal of implementing an international education program guided by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) that will focus on providing access to curriculum plans that center on inclusivity for all. While each Member State would still be able to modify the curriculum to meet their individual needs, participation in this program would also provide appropriate funding towards cooperating Member States to ensure the ability to sustain inclusive and equitable education goals. This initiative will provide a greater learning environment for children and equips students with skills, attitudes, and competencies for further education and employment. Georgia earnestly believes that if such a framework is implemented, Member States will obtain a higher standard of living while creating an inclusive and equitable education for all persons involved. 
                    
                    II. The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age
                    
                    The ever-evolving nature of our digital world has manufactured a plethora of new technological innovations that potentially create significant risk, most notably regarding protecting one’s privacy in correlation to these technological advances. This notion, coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic, which has generated an exponential rate of increased reliance on digital resources, proves the need for swift action to be taken to combat this rising issue. Yet, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), only 69% of Member States currently possess digital data privacy protection legislation, with Member States present within the regions of Africa and Asia possessing a significantly smaller percentage at 55%. Georgia expresses deep concern regarding the unrestricted usage of recently developed technologies such as extensive mass surveillance methods and malignant forms of artificial intelligence applications, which can produce significant risks to one’s right to privacy. Furthermore, Georgia is hopeful that by addressing these concerns and proposing pragmatic solutions to resolve these issues, Georgia can produce meaningful change towards this topic at our upcoming conference.
                    
                    The General Assembly Third Committee (GA3) first brought forth the topic The Right of Privacy in the Digital Age when the Assembly adopted resolution 68/167 in 2014; in this process, the Assembly acknowledged that privacy in a digital milieu is a human right and urged Member States to “respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital communication.” This resolution, in large part, concentrated upon the legal ethics behind widespread surveillance measures conducted by Member States and how to best monitor these measures for signs of misconduct. Since then, this topic has been continually brought before GA3, as well as additional United Nations (UN) entities, such as The World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) and the Human Rights Council (HRC). This multifaceted approach towards handling this topic is with just cause, as technological capabilities among Member States continue to grow to astronomical proportions. Evidence of this issue is present within A/HRC/44/24, in which the HRC cultivated the discussion upon the harmful effects specific facial recognition technologies pose, particularly in reference to their inappropriate usage upon peaceful assemblies. This growing challenge of sustaining efficient technological comprehension to mitigate harm best can also be noticed in A/HRC/48/31, a resolution Georgia has supported, focusing on the regulation of artificial intelligence systems and applications that have posed a potential threat to one’s right to privacy. Georgia aims to continue the discussion A/HRC/48/31 has manufactured and inspire fellow Member States to join us in taking a stand against dangerous methods of automation that jeopardize the right to privacy.
                    
                    Georgia recognizes that bold action is needed to maintain the right to privacy within a developing digital era. Accordingly, Georgia is proposing that fellow Member States with digital privacy legislation already in effect join us in a pledge to submit to annual data privacy screenings conducted by the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) to ensure proper awareness of evolving technological advances, and to assure the accountability of current data privacy commitments made by fellow Member States. These screenings would assist in preventing stagnation among Member States who have already addressed this topic in prior years but would also potentially aid in exposing unknown threats to data protection that may fall outside the realm of their current legislation. In addition to this proposal, Georgia also supports injecting funding into providing educational resources regarding this topic that give Member States without proper legislation on the topic a chance to learn further on the positive effects of the formation of these series of legislation. Georgia predicts this outreach method will also prove most fruitful to least developed countries, as only 45% of least developed countries have well-rounded data protection legislation and may struggle with finding access to resources to create and sustain legislation regarding this topic. By way of conclusion, Georgia advocates for our fellow Member States to join us in increasing our comprehension and methods of application towards handling the risks associated with The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age and is looking forward to contributing to the success of this effort at our upcoming conference.
