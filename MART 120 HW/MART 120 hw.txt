GUI, otherwise known as (graphical user interfaces) will let a user interact with a certain device or system with the help of graphical elements (aka windows, menus, icons, and more). CLI (command-line interface) lets a user interact with the device or system that they are using with the help of various commands. In a way that was easy for me to understand, one can interact with widgets or controls when using the GUI system, whereas when using the CLI system, you have to enter certain commands to perform certain tasks.
